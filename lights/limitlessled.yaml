# LimitlessLED smart light for MiLight devices
#
# The MiLights led strips controllers I use are the FUT035 for white-temperature
# control only (for use with high-CRI CCT LED strips where workarea white light
# primes over colourfulness). However, these controllers do not respond reliably
# to the "cct" device type, which uses an older inaccurate protocol for legacy
# CCT lights. Instead, the FUT035 controllers have to use the newer "rgbww"
# device type, even if they do not provide RGB outputs. This setting then works
# reliably, even if the frontend UI offers extra colour options that aren't
# relevant for white-only devices.

# Milight Hub emulator
#
# Controls MiLight devices using a DIY gateway emulator via MQTT. For
# prototyping purposes.
# Hardware device is an ESP8266 (NodeMCU 1.0 module) connected to a nRF24L01+
# transceiver and running custom firmware by Chris Mullins.
#
# MQTT topic formats:
#   commands: milight/commands/:device_id/:device_type/:group_id
#   states: milight/states/:device_id/:device_type/:group_id
# Placeholders:
#   :device_id = MiLight bridge ID linked to a device.
#   :device_type = Type of light controlled, based on compatible remote.
#   :group_id = Group a light is assigned to.

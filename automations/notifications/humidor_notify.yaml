# Check if humidity is too high or too low in the humidor
#
# Cigars should be kept in a humidity-controlled environment, between 65% and
# 74%, with the ideal sweet spot at 70%.
#
# Notifications are sent whenever humidity levels cross boundaries, and
# reminders are then sent every few hours until levels get back to normal. Only
# a few reminders are sent out however, to avoid notification spam when action
# cannot immediately be taken to bring humidity levels back to normal (say,
# while out of town).

# Check if radon levels are too high
#
# Radon (Rn) is an element that comes from the natural decay of underground
# uranium, thorium, and radium. It is a radioactive, colorless, and odorless
# noble gas. Radon-222 tends to accumulate in enclosed locations like houses.
# It has a short half-life of 3.8 days before decaying into other short-lived
# radioactive gases (Polonium-218, Lead-214, Bismuth-214, Polonium-214) then
# into solid, long-lasting, radiactive Lead-210. This means that when breathing
# in air or dust particles, radioactive isotopes either transmutate or get
# deposited inside the lungs, increasing the odds of developping lung cancer.
# Keeping a place well ventilated is a good way to mitigate this risk.
#
# Notifications are sent whenever radon levels reach tresholds, and reminders
# are then sent every few hours until levels get back to normal. Only
# a few reminders are sent out however, to avoid notification spam when action
# cannot immediately be taken to bring radiation levels back to normal (say,
# while out of town).

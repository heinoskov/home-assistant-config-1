#
# Webhook: IFTTT
#
# Blink is connected with IFTTT.com which sends a payload to Home Assistant
# whenevermotion is detected. This is faster than doing server-side polling, but
# it is not 100% garanteed.
#
# Blink payload format:
#   {
#       "action": "call_service",
#       "service": "input_boolean.turn_on",
#       "entity_id": "input_boolean.motion_front",
#       "name": "{{CameraName}}",
#       "time": " {{CreatedAt}}",
#       "token": "!secret ifttt_token"
#   }

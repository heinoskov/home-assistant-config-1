# Fully Kiosk Browser motion sensor
#
# The Fully app can only send "onMotion" events as it is stateless. Instead of
# coming up with a complicated yet fragile Javascript state-handler that would
# calculate the last time any motion was detected and then send an "off" signal
# and would survive across URL changes (but would fail if the Android device is
# offline or if the app is forced-closed), an extra server-side sensor is much
# sturdier, if a bit less accurate. It should turn off within 3-4 minutes after
# the last change.
#
# The "binary_sensor.kiosk_motion" is dynamically created by the first
# "onMotion" event call for a custom Javascript declared in all dashboards using
# the "Modern" theme. Two API calls are done sequentially, one to turn off the
# binary sensor, then other to turn it right  back on. This way the sensor state
# is guaranteed to change, and the  "last_changed" and "last_updated" timestamps
# along with it.
#
# @see /appdaemon/custom_css/modern/variables.yaml

# FireFighter Siren Monitor smoke alarm sensor
#
# The Ecolink FireFighter Z-Wave Plus for Smoke and CO Detectors does have a
# binary sensor exposed by the Z-Wave management console, but it does not relate
# to smoke or burglar ...and the unit has no configuration options exposed.
#
# The siren monitor returns 0x02 for both smoke and CO detection, or 0x00 when
# no such events are triggered.
#
# There are no garage, fireplace or any other fuel burning equipment here, and
# so there are no CO detectors that need to be listened to either.

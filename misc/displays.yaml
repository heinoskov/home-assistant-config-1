# Third-party component to get some basic information on an instance of the
# Fully app running on a connected Android device and to allow the toggling of
# its screen.

# Motion sensor is not integrated here, but instead is an API endpoint called
# by a custom JavaScript handler in the Moden HADashboard theme.
